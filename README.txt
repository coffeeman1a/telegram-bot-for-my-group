Now you can edit database users table in console
To add an admin type 'set_admin'
To delete user type 'delete_user'
To add an user type 'add_user
To show users table type 'show_users'
To authorize user type 'authorize_user'
To set user name type 'set_user_name'
To exit type 'ex' or 'exit'

also admin can send commands to bot in telegram
/authorize_user to authorize an user
/unauthorized_users to show all guests

When user starts chatting with bot, he will appear as a guest in database table, then you can authorize him
Errors now appear in session.json

timetable name format for example - timetable_ELBO-01-20_week_14

There is much more to do with this bot, I just need to show this code so i can get a job, at least I hope so
