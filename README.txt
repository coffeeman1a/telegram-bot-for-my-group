To add an admin to the Telegram bot, you will need to manually edit the config.json file. Follow the steps below:

Open the config.json file in a text editor.
Find the admins section in the file.
Add the Telegram user ID of the admin to the list of IDs in the admins section. Separate each ID with a comma.
Save the changes to the config.json file.
Once you have added the admin's Telegram user ID to the config.json file, you can authorize users to use the bot by adding their user IDs to the users section in the same way.
